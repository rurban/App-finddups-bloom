NAME
    App::finddups::bloom

SYNOPSIS
        finddups-bloom      # acting on /dedup

        finddups-bloom /dir
        finddups-bloom /dir | xargs rm        # printable filenames without spaces only

        finddups-bloom -0 /dir | xargs -0 rm  # quote unprintable chars and filenames containing space

DESCRIPTION
    Finds and prints most file duplicates under the given directory via
    bloom filters. Ignores symlinks and hardlinks.

OPTIONS
    --print0 | -0 quote unprintable filename characters for xargs -0

    --bloomsize expected number of files, defaults to 1_000_000;

    --bloomsize2 expected number of duplicates, defaults to 2000;

    --bloomerr wanted error rate, defaults to 0.01 i.e. 1%

    --maxcrc maximal file content size which is checked

    --verbose prints header and footer prefixed with #

    --help prints short usage

INTERNALS
    This code doesn't follow the contest rules, as it doesn't store the
    source links. It only checks and prints duplicates, and therefore can
    use fast and memory efficient Bloom filters.

    The default accuracy is 99.99% for 1 million files which should satisfy
    all practical purposes. And if you care for more run it a second time,
    combined with rm. It is fast because it uses bloom filters not hashes,
    hence the 99.99% and not 100% and it doesn't print the source for the
    duplicates, only the duplicates.

    To remove the duplicates apply "rm" to the list of entries, such as

        finddups-bloom -0 | xargs -0 rm

    It needs between 20MB and 55MB memory, compared to 333MB with the
    reference perl5 code using perl hashes.
