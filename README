NAME
    App::finddups::bloom

SYNOPSIS
        finddups-bloom      # acting on /dedup

        finddups-bloom /dir
        finddups-bloom /dir | xargs rm        # printable filenames without spaces only

        finddups-bloom -0 /dir | xargs -0 rm  # quote \0 and filenames containing space

DESCRIPTION
    Finds and prints most file duplicates under the given directory. Ignores
    symlinks and hardlinks.

INTERNALS
    This code doesn't follow the contest rules, as it doesn't store the
    source links. It only checks and prints duplicates, and therefore can
    use fast and memory efficient Bloom filters.

    The accuracy is 99.99% which should satisfy all practical purposes, and
    if you care for more run it a second time, combined with rm. It is fast
    because it uses bloom filters not hashes, hence the 99.99% and not 100%
    and it doesn't print the source for the duplicates, only the duplicates.

    To remove the duplicates apply "rm" to the list of entries, such as

        finddups-bloom | xargs rm

    If you care about filenames which might contain \0 characters use the
    option -0 similar to find and xargs from findutils
